# Apis - Users informations queries

Users Api is defined as an endpoint to provide count and user list based on users properties queries. For ex: count the number of users of application X in country Y that are in the 18-35 years age range.

These apis are hosted under [http://api.cvd.io/{area}/users/](http://api.cvd.io/{area}/users/).

The following endpoints are actually available within the service:

* [X] [Count users corresponding to the provided properties in querystring](#countforproperties)
      * [x] ex : http://api.cvd.io/liptip/users/count?country=Algeria&gender=male
* [X] [Get the list of facebookids of the users corresponding to the provided properties in querystring](#facebookidsforproperties)
      * [x]  ex : http://api.cvd.io/liptip/users/facebookids?country=Algeria&gender=female&conjugalsituation=InACouple
* [X] [Get all the properties of a user by it's id](#userproperties)
      * [x] ex : http://api.cvd.io/liptip/users/withfacebookid/10154292021876564
      

Notes:
* this service is hosted by the http://gw-usersproperties.azurewebsites.net/ app service in isolation
* an url rewrite is used to provide the host under api.cvd.io
* queries are cached
* __actually there is no automated job to compute these data !!!__
